Note Storage: 
--Being proactive when building a project requires 
outlining the requirements of the project before beginning.
Building the structure or code outline is best practice. 

After working haphazardly for the past 2 days(4hrs total time), I couldn't come to understand the project and proceeded forward w/instruction.
